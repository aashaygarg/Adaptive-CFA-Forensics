# Adaptive CFA Forensics

# Requirements
python >= 3.6

PIL
pytorch
numpy
tqdm
matplotlib
scikit-learn

In addition, the following files require pytorch with CUDA enabled:
detect_forgeries_interactive.py
detect_forgeries_multiple.py
train_model.py

# Dataset
The dataset used in our article can be found [here](http://dev.ipol.im/~qbammey/dresden_demosaicing_forgery_detection_dataset_v1/).

# Usage

### Train or retrain a network
```
train_model.py [-h] [-m MODEL] [-j JPEG] [-b BLOCK_SIZE] [-o OUT]
                      [-l LEARNING_RATE] [-a EPOCHS_AUXILIARY]
                      [-B EPOCHS_BLOCKWISE] [-s BATCH_SIZE]
                      input [input ...]
```
To use a pretrained network and retrain it on data, specify the pretrained model with -m.
All images are kept in GPU memory at the same time. As a consequence, training on a large database require more GPU memory.

### Detect forgeries on a single image with the proposed method
```
detect_forgeries.py [-h] [-m MODEL] [-j JPEG]
                                    [-o OUT]
                                    [-b BLOCK_SIZE]
                                    input
```
The model can be specified with -m. By default, uses the pretrained model (not retrained on the database).
If the output image path is not specified, results will be plotted interactively.

### Detect forgeries on multiple images with the intermediate values method:
```
choi_intermediate_values.py [-h] [-j JPEG] [-b BLOCK_SIZE] [-o OUT]
                                   input [input ...]
```
This is an implementation of the method described in
Choi, C., Choi, J., & Lee, H. (2011). CFA pattern identification of digital cameras using intermediate value counting. MM&Sec'11.

### Detect forgeries on multiple images with the variance of colour difference method:
```
shin_variance.py [-h] [-j JPEG] [-b BLOCK_SIZE] [-o OUT]
                        input [input ...]
```
This is an implementation of the method described in
Hyun Jun Shin, Jong Ju Jeon, and Il Kyu Eom "Color filter array pattern identification using variance of color difference image," Journal of Electronic Imaging 26(4), 043015 (7 August 2017). https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JEI.26.4.043015
